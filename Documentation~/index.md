# MeshSync

Working together with [MeshSyncDCCPlugins](https://github.com/Unity-Technologies/MeshSyncDCCPlugins), MeshSync is a package for synchronizing meshes/models editing in DCC tools into Unity in real time.
This allows devs to immediately see how things will look in-game while modelling.  

## Supported Platforms

- Windows 64 bit
- Mac
- Linux

# Basic usage

Create a server object by clicking this menu: GameObject -> MeshSync -> Create Server. 
This object has [MeshSyncServer](en/MeshSyncServer.md) component that handles the sync process.
