# MeshSync

Working together with [MeshSyncDCCPlugins](https://github.com/Unity-Technologies/MeshSyncDCCPlugins), MeshSync is a package for synchronizing meshes/models editing in DCC tools into Unity in real time. 
This allows devs to immediately see how things will look in-game while modelling.  

Installation is done via the [Package Manager](https://docs.unity3d.com/Manual/upm-ui.html).  
Please ensure that *Show preview packages* is checked to search for MeshSync.
