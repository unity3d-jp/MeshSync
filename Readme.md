# MeshSync

Working together with [MeshSyncDCCPlugins](https://github.com/Unity-Technologies/MeshSyncDCCPlugins), MeshSync is a package for synchronizing meshes/models editing in DCC tools into Unity in real time. 
This allows devs to immediately see how things will look in-game while modelling.  

MeshSync is currently a preview package, and therefore the installation requires preview packages to be enabled.

* Unity 2019.x  
  Open [Package Manager](https://docs.unity3d.com/Manual/upm-ui.html) and ensure that **Show preview packages** is checked. 
  Then, search for MeshSync.

  Steps to enable preview packages:
  1. Go to Edit > Project Settings
  1. Select Package Manager in the Project Settings window
  1. Check **Enable Preview Packages** checkbox
  1. Click **I understand**
  
  Then, open [Package Manager](https://docs.unity3d.com/Manual/upm-ui.html) and search for MeshSync.
