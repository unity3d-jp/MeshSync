# Contribution Guidelines

Thank you for your interest in contributing to MeshSync! We are
incredibly excited to see how members of our community will use and extend the
MeshSync toolkit. To facilitate your contributions, we've outlined a brief set
of guidelines to ensure that your extensions can be easily integrated.

## Communication

First, please read through our [code of conduct](CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md), as we
expect all our contributors to follow it.

Second, before starting on a project that you intend to contribute to MeshSync 
(whether environments or modifications to the codebase), we
**strongly** recommend posting on our
[Issues page](https://github.com/unity3d-jp/MeshSync/issues)
and briefly outlining the changes you plan to make. This will enable us to
provide some context that may be helpful for you. This could range from advice
and feedback on how to optimally perform your changes or reasons for not doing
it.

## Git Branches
The dev branch corresponds to the most recent version of the project.
Note that this branch may be unstable.

When contributing to the project, please make sure that your Pull Request (PR) contains the following:

* Detailed description of the changes performed
* Corresponding changes to documentation, unit tests and sample environments (if
  applicable)
* Summary of the tests performed to validate your changes
* Issue numbers that the PR resolves (if any)

## Environments

We are also actively open to adding community contributed environments as
examples, as long as they are small, simple, demonstrate a unique feature of
the platform, and provide a unique non-trivial challenge to modern
machine learning algorithms. Feel free to submit these environments with a
PR explaining the nature of the environment and task.

## Contributor License Agreements

When you open a pull request, you will be asked to acknolwedge our Contributor License Agreement. 
We allow both individual contributions and contributions made on behalf of companies.
